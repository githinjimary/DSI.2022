# DSI.2022
SPRINT2
the notebooks are "MG_SPRINT2" and "MG_TRAINING_&DASHBOARD"
DUring this second sprint, I chose to forecast covid 19 spread and effects of the infection across many countires around the world.
The motivation of this project is to be able to have the same project done in two different ways and compare the outcomes. 
That is, my masters' project is on modelling of diseases(covid 19) using mathematical models. I'll get the chance to model covid 19 using differential equations 
and using machine learning. This could lead to a great PhD project.
